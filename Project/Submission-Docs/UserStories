Story: Help the City connect all the roads between the houses that use the least inventory

As a player, I want to help the city connect all the roads between the houses using the least possible inventory so that I reconnect the transportation system.


BDD Specifications:

As a user, when I open the application I should see a game description and an option to start the game, so that I can read the game description and understand what the game is before I start playing it.

As a user, when I start the game, I should be able to see a bunch of houses that need to be connected so that I intuitively know what to connect.

As a user, when I build a path between two houses, I should see the score board updating to indicate the length of path covered so that I can keep a track on the minimal path to cover.

As a user, when I should be able to compete with another player so that I have fun and competition while playing the game.

As a user, when I compete against another player and submit my solution, I must see a message indicating the winner and our scores.

As a user, if I trace the shortest path that connects all the houses and the competing player does not, then I would be declared as the winner and the competing player as the loser.

As a user, if I trace the shortest path that connects all the houses and the competing player does so too, then the result would be declared as a tie.

As a user, I have limited time to play the game and trace the shortest path. Incase, I do not submit my solution, the game should automatically submit my solution and release the results.
