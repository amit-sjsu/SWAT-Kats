Using this game puzzle, students will make decisions and try to connect the all cities in short distance.

Pre Requiste for game is :
- Mathematics: Geometry Level 2/3 and up
- Exploring shape and space
- Age: 10+

Areas Covered with this game:
- Problem Solving
- Algorimthms

Lets follow any one algorithm for our game to get minimum spanning tree.
- As we had discussion on kruskal's algorithm and found it to be good. We can use Kruskal's algorithm for our game.

- Discription on how we can built the game:-
  At the begining of the game we will give number of moves to the user which will be equivalent to minimum moves required to connect all 
  nodes. Hence In-order to connect all the nodes user has to follow minimum path else he/she will be out of move and the game would be over.
